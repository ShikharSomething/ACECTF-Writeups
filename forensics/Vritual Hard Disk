The challenge provided a file without an extension. Using FTK Imager, I analyzed its contents and identified it as a virtual hard disk. Inside, I found an encrypted flag along with a key. The encrypted flag was:

CTCHHW{7t3_h1hw3p3sq3_s37i33r_a0l_4li_a3}


Recognizing it as a Vigen√®re cipher, I used the key "cryforme" and decrypted it with dcode.fr. The final flag was:

`ACECTF{7h3_d1ff3r3nc3_b37w33n_y0u_4nd_m3}
