```def reverse_file(input_file, output_file):

    reversed_data = data[::-1]  # Reverse the byte order

    with open(output_file, "wb") as f:
        f.write(reversed_data)

    print(f"Reversed file saved as {output_file}")


# Example usage
input_file = "something.png"  # Change this to your input file name
output_file = "output.bin"  # Change this to your desired output file name
reverse_file(input_file, output_file)```

use this script on the png file
